        This is a brief and engaging description of the movie. It should hook the viewer and give them a sense of what the story is about, the themes explored, and maybe a hint at the tone. For example: "In a dystopian future where water is the most precious resource, a lone drifter must fight against powerful corporations to protect a hidden oasis and the hope it represents for humanity."
